# Portfolio Website


> This project is about creating a portfolio web page for the mobile and desktop version using best practices for HTML,CSS, JS, linters, GitHub Flow rules and documentation of work. It is important to start with a new repository and setup the linters, follow a design template for the portfolio or create your own through Figma and code it using HTML, CSS and JS. I've built the website using a Figma template provided by Microverse.
       I used the linters - GitHub Actions, Lighthouse, Webhint and Stylelint to make this project error-free. Also, all the other files except the HTML, CSS and JS files were added to feature branches to make the main branch remain in best possible condition and stable.
